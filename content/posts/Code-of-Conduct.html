<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Consultations are set to help and support students - raised concerns about authenticity and plagiarism and the amount of individual contribution to the work, individual consultations between students and DASA members are not to be held.</p></li>
<li><p>The expectation for all submissions is that the works is completed on your own, not a collective effort.</p></li>
<li><p>DASA is for troubleshooting only, suggestion on solutions is not provided.</p></li>
<li><p>Troubleshooting is defined as covering the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technical errors with RStudio assuming that you have done investigation on your own, including suggested forums, Google search</li>
<li>Errors are to be shared within the chat function of Zoom and not screen shared</li>
<li>Clarification on assignment questions meaning and interpretation are not covered and should be sought from the Lecturer</li>
<li>DASA will not advise on assignments, clarification and discussion is to be around lecture, tutorials or self education works only</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>There are many different interpretations and operations/functions within R Studio where each solution has its own advantages and disadvantages. RSCRIPT IS SUBJECT TO PLAGIARISM LAWS. When you attend consultation, and do not have a question, the intention is that you learn and not copy and paste other peoples work. Students identified for plagiarism of RScript will receive zero marks.</p>
